/* 
Palindromes are words that are the same forward or backward. For example, 
the words "noon" and "kayak" are a palindromes.
 
Write a function to check if a lowercased string of letters is a palindrome. 
If the word is palindrome, return true. If it isn't, return false.

Example input: "motorbike"
Example output: false

Example input: "rotator" 
Example output: true

Grandpa's hand isn't as steady as it used to be. You finally convinced him

Your function should take in a string of characters and return a
